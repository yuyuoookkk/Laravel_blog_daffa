    <p>
      Microbreaks are short, intentional pauses designed to reset your focus and reduce mental fatigue.
      When planned thoughtfully, they can dramatically improve the quality of your deep work.
    </p>
    <h2>Why Microbreaks Work</h2>
    <p>
      Your attention is a finite resource. Regular, brief resets prevent cognitive overload and help you
      return to tasks with energy and clarity.
    </p>
    <h2>How to Implement</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Work in 25–50 minute blocks followed by a 3–5 minute break.</li>
      <li>Stand up, stretch, and hydrate—avoid switching to another screen.</li>
      <li>Use a timer and protect your break time like any other task.</li>
    </ul>
