      Starting a tech blog is a powerful way to learn in public, build credibility, and create opportunities.
      Here’s a simple, sustainable approach to get started.
    </p>
    <h2>Pick a Focus</h2>
    <p>Choose a niche that matches your curiosity—front-end patterns, DevOps, accessibility, or anything you can write about consistently.</p>
    <h2>Publish Consistently</h2>
    <p>Define a cadence you can sustain. Even two high-quality posts a month compounds quickly.</p>
    <h2>Keep It Useful</h2>
    <p>Teach something concrete in every post: snippets, checklists, and examples beat theory alone.</p>
